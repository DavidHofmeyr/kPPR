Title: Projection Pursuit Regression using Local Linear Kernel Smoothing
Version: 0.1.0
Author: David P. Hofmeyr
Maintainer: David P. Hofmeyr <dhofmeyr@sun.ac.za>
Description: Implements Friedman's PPR model based on a local linear kernel smoother. Unlike the base
    function ppr(), which uses iterative reweighted least squares, the present implementation uses
    exact gradient based optimisation. This makes this implementation slower on low-dimensional problems,
    but potentially substantially faster in higher dimensions.
